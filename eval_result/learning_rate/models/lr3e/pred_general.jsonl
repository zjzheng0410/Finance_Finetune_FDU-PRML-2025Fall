Although self-driving cars have the potential to greatly decrease the number of accidents on the road, there are still challenges to overcome before they can be safely deployed. \nOne of the main challenges is the technology itself. Autonomous vehicles are powered by artificial intelligence, an incredibly complex computer system. For these cars to operate safely, they must be able to accurately detect and react to their environment. This requires a compute-intensive algorithm that is able to recognize and respond to signals in real-time with near perfect accuracy. Furthermore, the sensors used to detect the environment must have a very high degree of accuracy in order to prevent any misreadings. \nAnother challenge surrounds safety. Autonomous vehicles must be programmed to follow local laws and safety regulations, such as speed limits, lane markings and traffic signals. Additionally, the cars must be designed to respond and adjust in unpredictable conditions, such as bad weather. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, autonomous vehicles must be designed in such a way that a human operator can take control when needed.\n\nOther challenges include cultural, legal, and economic barriers. The idea of self-driving cars can be a hard sell to the public and the authorities, as people may feel unsafe traveling by driverless cars. Legislators can also create laws that limit the use of self-driving cars, which can be a hurdle for developers. Economically, the cost of producing autonomous vehicles is still very high, making them less accessible to consumers. \n\nIn conclusion, while autonomous vehicles have potential to revolutionize the way we travel, there are still significant challenges to overcome before they can become mainstream. Development teams must create innovative solutions to these issues in order to make the dream of self-driving cars a reality.", "prediction": "-word article summarizing the challenges associated with developing self-driving cars.\nassistant\nSelf-driving cars are becoming increasingly popular, but developing them is a complex and challenging task. The technology requires a combination of hardware and software components, as well as a large amount of data to train the algorithms. In addition, the cars must be able to operate in a variety of environments, from urban areas to rural roads, and must be able to handle a wide range of weather conditions. \n\nOne of the biggest challenges in developing self-driving cars is the need for accurate and reliable sensors. These sensors must be able to detect and track objects in the environment, such as other vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles. They must also be able to accurately measure the distance and speed of these objects. In addition, the sensors must be able to detect and track the road and other features of the environment, such as lane markings and traffic signs. \n\nAnother challenge is the need for robust algorithms to process the data from the sensors and make decisions. These algorithms must be able to accurately interpret the data and make decisions based on it. They must also be able to handle unexpected situations, such as sudden changes in the environment or unexpected obstacles. \n\nThe algorithms must also be able to handle the large amount of data that is generated by the sensors.

{"id": 757, "instruction": "Negative properties of continuously compounded returns", "input": "", "reference": "What you're missing is the continuous compounding computation doesn't work that way.  If you compound over n periods of time and a rate of return of r, the formula is e^(r*n), as you have to multiply the returns together with a mulitplicative base of 1.  Otherwise consider what 0 does to your formula.  If I get a zero return, I have a zero result which doesn't make sense.  However, in my formula I'd still get the 1 which is what I'm starting and thus the no effect is the intended result. Continuous compounding would give e^(-.20*12) = e^(-2.4) = .0907 which is a -91% return so for each $100 invested, the person ends up with $9.07 left at the end.  It may help to picture that the function e^(-x) does asymptotically approach zero as x tends to infinity, but that is as bad as it can get, so one doesn't cross into the negative unless one wants to do returns in a Complex number system with imaginary numbers in here somehow. For those wanting the usual compounding, here would be that computation which is more brutal actually: For your case it would be (1-.20)^12=(0.8)^12=0.068719476736 which is to say that someone ends up with 6.87% in the end.  For each $100 had in the beginning they would end with $6.87 in the end. Consider someone starting with $100 and take 20% off time and time again you'd see this as it would go down to $80 after the first month and then down to $64 the second month as the amount gets lower the amount taken off gets lower too.  This can be continued for all 12 terms.  Note that the second case isn't another $20 loss but only $16 though it is the same percentage overall. Some retail stores may do discounts on discounts so this can happen in reality.  Take 50% off of something already marked down 50% and it isn't free, it is down 75% in total.  Just to give a real world example where while you think a half and a half is a whole, taking half and then half of a half is only three fourths, sorry to say.  You could do this with an apple or a pizza if you want a food example to consider. Alternatively, consider the classic up and down case where an investment goes up 10% and down 10%.  On the surface, these should cancel and negate each other, right?  No, in fact the total return is down 1% as the computation would be (1.1)(.9)=.99 which is slightly less than 1. Continuous compounding may be a bit exotic from a Mathematical concept but the idea of handling geometric means and how compounding returns comes together is something that is rather practical for people to consider.", "prediction": "system\nYou are a helpful assistant.\nuser\nNegative properties of continuously compounded returns\nassistant\nThe main problem with continuously compounded returns is that they are not additive.  If you have two investments with returns of 10% and 20% respectively, the total return is 30%.  If you have two investments with continuously compounded returns of 10% and 20% respectively, the total return is 27.18%.  This is because the 10% return is applied to the initial investment, and the 20% return is applied to the investment after the 10% return has been applied.  This is a problem because it is not intuitive, and it is not consistent with the way that most people think about returns.  For example, if you have an investment that has a 10% return, and you invest an additional 10% of the initial investment, the total return is 21%, not 20%.  This is because the 10% return is applied to the initial investment, and the additional 10% is applied to the investment after the 10% return has been applied.  This is a problem because it is not intuitive, and it is not consistent with the way that most people think about returns."}

Most long terms users of Kelly tend to stick in the 1/4 to 1/2 Kelly unit range to try and stay sane and retain a margin of error. See below for how large the typical swings can be with full Kelly:  2) Garbage in, garbage out. If you are making errors in pricing your actual edge, Kelly becomes very wrong very fast, easily leading you to a high chance of ruin if you are over estimating your true edge. As most people do massively over estimate their edges, Kelly simply pushes them far into territory where risk of ruin is high. 3) A Kelly user prefers to back likely outcomes over non likely ones, even to the point where they prefer a smaller % edge if the chances of winning are better. Compare the below comparison of growth between two betting scenarios (decimal odds, so for the percantage chances do 1/odds):  In this case, despite the percentage edge on the red bet being higher than that of the green, in terms of bankroll growth it ends up only being roughly as good to a kelly gambler as the smaller edge on the more likely event.

It may help to pick out a specific thing you want, or want to replace. My \"rules\" used to say that i was always allowed to spend money on books, music, and needed tools. Then i convinced myself that shelves are tools for storing other things. And that furniture is shelving for people. And that art, if it really speaks to me, is akin  to books.

One step at a time, with all the steps making sense. I will still spend entirely too long agonizing over minor purchases, at times -- but that's about convincing myself that I like the choice I'm making, not about the price  per se.
